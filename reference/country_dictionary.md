# Country dictionary for standardizing country names and codes

`country_dictionary` provides a set of lookup tables used to standardize
country names and country codes in occurrence datasets.

The dictionary is built from `rnaturalearthdata::map_units110` and
consolidates a wide variety of country name variants (in several
languages and formats), as well as multiple coding systems, into a
single suggested standardized name.

This object is used internally by functions that clean or harmonize
country fields, ensuring that country names in occurrence datasets
(e.g., `"Brasil"`,`"brasil"`, `"BR"`, `"BRA"`, `"République Française"`)
are all mapped consistently to a single standardized form (`"brazil"`,
`"france"`, etc.).

## Usage

``` r
country_dictionary
```

## Format

A named list of two data frames:

- `country_name`:

  A data frame with two columns:

  `country_name`

  :   Character. Lowercased and accent-stripped country name variants
      (from multiple `rnaturalearthdata` fields such as *name*,
      *name_long*, *abbrev*, *formal_en*, and alternative names in
      several languages).

  `country_suggested`

  :   Character. The standardized country name, derived from the `name`
      column of `map_units110`, also lowercased and accent-stripped.

- `country_code`:

  A data frame with two columns:

  `country_code`

  :   Character. Country codes from several systems, including ISO-2,
      ISO-3, FIPS, postal codes, and others, after filtering invalid or
      ambiguous codes.

  `country_suggested`

  :   Character. The standardized country name corresponding to each
      code.

## Details

The dictionary is generated by:

- extracting multiple name and code fields from
  `rnaturalearthdata::map_units110`,

- converting names to lowercase and removing accents,

- converting codes to uppercase,

- removing invalid or ambiguous codes (e.g., `-99`, `"J"`, various
  country mismatches),

- and ensuring uniqueness across all entries.
